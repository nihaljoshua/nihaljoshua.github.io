  <h3>About me........
    Whether online or in person, connections are the foundation of the professional world. 
    In many cases, making a great first impression is crucial to solidifying a professional relationship. 
    As a result, it is important to have a quick and effective pitch about your experience, aims and relevant personal details.

    Many professional connections are made on websites or social media platforms, and the 
    “About Me” blurb offers an opportunity to provide this personal pitch online. 
    If you use any of these web-based resources, you might consider writing an “About Me” that allows readers to get to know you better. 
    This article discusses what an “About Me” is, explains how to write one and provides examples.
